<p>The Coachella Kid left a plain trail. After killing Deputy Jack Welden with an
iron cot leg, he stole a gun and ammunition, saddled one of the sheriff’s
horses and headed straight for the desert. It all happened only a few minutes
after the jury had been sent to deliberate on the guilt or innocence of the
Coachella Kid, who was charged with first degree murder.</p>

<p>It was the first time the Kid had ever been tried&mdash;his first time to face a
judge and jury. Only luck had allowed him to travel his crooked trail this
long. Several times he had escaped the clutches of the law by the narrowest of
margins. Twice he had killed deputy sheriffs&mdash;but no one could prove it. The
Coachella Kid was a cold-eyed killer, contemptuous of the law; and for five
years he had nursed a bitter hate against Dave Fulton, the sheriff who had
finally arrested him.</p>

<p>The Coachella Kid was a small man, wiry as a bobcat, soft-spoken; he was not
over thirty-five years of age. There was nothing conspicuous about him. He had
been very quiet during his trial, until the sheriff, speaking from the witness
stand, recited a brief résumé of what he knew about the Coachella Kid’s past.
Then the Kid got to his feet.</p>

<p>“Me and him loved the same girl five years ago,” he said, barely loud enough
for the jury to hear. “He got her by lyin’ to her about me. He’s scared I’m
goin’ to make him pay for them lies; so he’s tryin’ to git me hung.”</p>

<p>Then the Kid sat down and refused to talk any more.</p>

<p>But the Kid was free now, well mounted and armed. Men saw him ride through
Yucca City; and they recognized the sheriff’s black horse. Ten miles farther
on he rode the length of the Main street at Signal Rock, where he was seen and
recognized. It would have been easy for him to circle both towns.</p>

<p>At the Smoke Tree ranch he stopped to water his horse and fill an enormous
canteen, which he had stolen from the sheriff’s stable. There was only one
cowboy at the ranch at the time, and he did not know the rider was an escaped
prisoner until the sheriff arrived an hour later.</p>

<p>The Coachella Kid did not hurry. He was heading for the worst spot in the
desert&mdash;a section where rain never falls, where there are no water-holes,
where the blackened rocks are like uncooled lava. Heat waves shimmered and
danced before him as he rode toward the vague line of broken hills. Mirages
appeared across stretches of dry lake beds. The Coachella Kid paid them no
heed.</p>

<p>Mile after mile he rode, scourged by thirst, but refusing to touch the
precious fluid in his canteen. He knew the horse must die, but he wanted to
reach those hills before taking to foot travel. He knew of a single
water-hole, miles and miles beyond the hills; and he knew that the one canteen
of water would enable him to make that spot on foot. From there another full
canteen would take him to a ranch where he would be safe for awhile.</p>


<p class='sb'>The Coachella Kid had a sinister purpose in making this trip.</p>

<p>He knew Dave Fulton very well indeed. With his only deputy lying dead, Dave
Fulton would ride alone; and Dave Fulton rarely failed to get his man. It
would have been a simple matter for the Kid to ambush and kill the sheriff,
thus delaying any pursuit for several days. But the Kid wanted a more
satisfactory revenge.</p>

<p>That night he made a dry camp in a clump of ocotillo. After riding almost to
the clump, he turned right on a back-track for some distance, swung to the
left in a wide circle and came to the clump from almost an opposite direction.
If the sheriff followed the Kid’s horse tracks in the sand, he must first ride
up close to the bandit’s hiding place.</p>

<p>The Kid left the weary horse saddled and tied. It was only a few more miles to
the broken hills. The Kid had no food, but that did not worry him. Once across
the hills, with the sheriff disposed of, he would have a chance to kill a sage
rabbit or something. He had eaten buzzards and rattlesnakes, when hard
pressed.</p>

<p>But the sheriff did not come along that night, because the sheriff, several
miles behind, was saving his horse. Shortly after daylight the Coachella Kid
mounted his horse and rode on. The heat was almost unbearable now, and the Kid
realized that he would be lucky to reach the hills. His eyes were swollen from
the heat, his face burned raw from the sun reflections on the sand. This was
the land of a hundred and thirty degrees in the shade&mdash;and no shade.</p>

<p>The Kid had long since ceased to watch his back trail, because the eye strain
made his head throb. He drank sparingly of the warm water, cursed the sun and
the sand and lashed the stumbling horse with a rope-end. It seemed ages and
ages before he reached the rocky hills, where they angled up a small canyon.
The heat was stifling. The horse was weaving drunkenly. The Kid dismounted.
Unfastening the heavy canteen from the saddle, he booted the horse in the
belly.</p>

<p>“You’re through,” he told the suffering animal. “Buzzards will git a feed
for once in their lives, and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>An idea struck him suddenly. Whipping out his sixshooter, he shot the animal
dead. The crack of the revolver echoed back from the rocks and the Kid
wondered whether any one had heard it. With an old knife he had taken from the
dead deputy he cut a generous hunk of meat from the horse. It would be enough
to feed him for several meals, and was better than taking a chance on
rattlesnakes or buzzards. Then he swung the canteen over his shoulder and went
on. The heat of the sand almost cooked his feet. As he searched for just the
right place he purposely staggered, making tracks like a drunken man,
indicating to any possible pursuer that he was nearly at the point of
collapse. Finally he went through a narrow cut in the rocks, dropped his
canteen in the shade and sat down. Here was the spot where he would get even
with Dave Fulton.</p>


<p class='sb'>He took a generous drink, recapped the canteen and sat down again. Even in
that shade the heat was terrific. Not a breath of air stirred. He examined his
sixshooter gingerly, because it was so hot. The chunk of horse meat was
already getting dry, like jerky.</p>

<p>For two hours or more the Coachella Kid sat there, suffering acutely from the
heat, wondering whether the sheriff had really followed him. Suppose he had
not? Suppose he guessed why the Kid had gone away openly? The Kid cursed
grimly.</p>

<p>Suddenly his keen ears detected a sound&mdash;the sound of boots in sand. He froze
against the rock, his cocked gun in his hand. A shadow struck across the
narrow opening, and the crunch of footsteps came closer. It was Dave Fulton,
hunched, watchful as a hunting cat. The Kid blended well with the rocks; and
perhaps the sheriff’s eyes were a little blinded from the glaring sunlight. He
was carrying his sixshooter tightly in his right hand.</p>

<p>Then the Coachella Kid, as deadly of aim as a striking rattler, fired the
first shot; he fired it at the sheriff’s gun hand, and the sheriff’s gun flew
from his numbed fingers and clattered down among the rocks.</p>

<p>As quick as a flash the sheriff dropped flat on his left side, twisting as he
fell. His clawing left hand found the gun. The Coachella Kid managed to swing
his head and shoulders behind a rock, while the sheriff, shooting with the
wrong hand, and from a bad position, fired five shots at what little he could
see of the Kid. None of them took effect, and when the Kid knew the sheriff’s
gun was empty he came from behind the rock.</p>

<p>The sheriff looked at him through red-rimmed eyes, and the Kid laughed
insanely at him. He forced the sheriff to his feet, took away his belt and
gun. Then he took the sheriff’s nearly empty canteen and drank it dry,
flinging it far off in the rocks.</p>

<p>“You fell for my trap, didn’t you, Dave?” He chuckled huskily.</p>

<p>“I found the horse,” replied the sheriff, “and then I seen your tracks. I&mdash;I
thought you was about all in, Kid.”</p>

<p>“Fooled you, eh?” jeered the Kid.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the sheriff wearily.</p>

<p>“Why? I’ve allus said I’d git you some day, Fulton. You thought you’d send me
to the gallows, eh? You was wishin’ me plenty hell, wasn’t you? Well, I
trapped you out here to give you a little taste of hell. I could have shot
you&mdash;easy. But that ain’t revenge. No livin’ man can walk back to that Smoke
Tree ranch&mdash;and that’s the nearest water. The buzzards will finish you. Me,
I’m goin’ the other way. I’ve got food and I’ve got water. You’re thirsty
right now.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’m thirsty,” admitted the sheriff. “But why didja kill Jack Welden?”</p>

<p>“Why? You fool, I had to kill him to git away. They can’t hang you any higher
for killin’ two than they can for killin’ one.”</p>

<p>“Then you admit murderin’ Ab Hill?”</p>

<p>“Admit it? Of course, I admit it.”</p>

<p>The sheriff’s split lip twisted in a curious smile.</p>

<p>“I was pretty sure of it&mdash;but you never can tell about a jury.”</p>

<p>“What about the jury?” asked the Coachella Kid hoarsely.</p>

<p>“They’d found you not guilty. The foreman told me they’d just reached a
decision when we learned you had killed Welden and made your escape.”</p>

<p>The Kid’s face twisted queerly and he licked his cracked and bleeding lips
with his dry tongue.</p>

<p>“Not guilty?” he whispered. “Not guilty? I’ll be damned!”</p>

<p>He backed up a few steps, staring at the sheriff. Not guilty! Why, he didn’t
have to kill Welden. He could have been free if he had waited a few minutes. A
black shadow passed over the glaring white sand, and he glanced up at a huge
buzzard, moving about on motionless wings. He shifted his burning eyes to the
sheriff and laughed queerly&mdash;a sound like the crumpling of paper.</p>

<p>“You can’t tell about a jury,” he said. “You jist&mdash;can’t&mdash;tell&mdash;about....”</p>

<p>“Your canteen’s leakin’,” said the sheriff huskily.</p>

<p>The Coachella Kid started to look, jerked back, his cocked gun covering the
sheriff. He was wise in the ways of gunmen and their tricks.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” he whispered. “I’m no damn fool.”</p>

<p>“Look at it,” urged the sheriff.</p>

<p>The Coachella Kid snarled wickedly as he backed toward the canteen. His heel
struck it, and it rang emptily. As quick as a flash the Kid half-turned and
swept it from the sand; but in that flash the sheriff stepped behind the rock,
leaving the Kid standing there dangling his empty, bullet-riddled canteen in
his left hand.</p>

<p>With a withering curse, the Kid ran erratically to the tall rock, searching
with burning eyes for the sheriff, who was somewhere out there in that glare.
He flung the useless canteen from him and leaned helplessly against the rock.
No use to follow the sheriff. He was crazy if he thought he could make that
far-away water-hole.</p>

<p>Thirty minutes later, far off the slope of the hill, the sheriff shuffled up
to a jumble of lava rocks, from under which he dug a large canteen of water.
He drank sparingly in the shade and splashed some of it over his head.</p>

<p>“I can easy make it back to my horse by dark,” he assured himself, “and by
mornin’ I can be pretty close to Smoke Tree. It’s hell on a fellow’s head and
feet; but this old desert ain’t hard to beat&mdash;if you’ve got water.”</p>

<p>He took another small drink, corked the canteen carefully and got to his feet.</p>

<p>“I reckon them buzzards has done lit some’eres,” he muttered, after scanning
the sky above the hills.</p>

<p>“You can shore fool a jury&mdash;but buzzards know.”</p>
